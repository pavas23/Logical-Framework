## Infix_Expression_By_InOrder_Traversal_of_ParseTree

-  The function InorderTraversalOfParseTree is defined and it outputs the infix expression back by in-order traversal.
-  It initially prints the left subtree, then root node data and then right subtree.
-  If right subtree is empty, It will just print the left subtree and root node data.
-  If left subtree is empty, It would print, root node data and then right subtree.
-  If no subtrees, then only root node data will be printed.
-  If no root node data and no subtrees then NULL would be returned.
