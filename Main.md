## Functions
>
> - Write a function to convert the infix propositional logic expression into a prefix propositional logic expression.
> - Write a function to convert the prefix expression into a rooted binary parse tree.
> - Write a function to traverse the parse tree to output the infix expression back by in-order traversal of the parse tree.
> - Write a function to compute the height of a parse tree.
> - Write a function to evaluate the truth value of a propositional logic formula, given the truth values of each propositional atom by traversing the tree in a bottom up fashion.<br><br>
